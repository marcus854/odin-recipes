    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is Italian sausage with stuffed shells. It's not overflowing with
        cheese, but the other flavors overcompensate to make this a satisfying dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also recommended to run fresh spinach through the food processor for an extra
        healthy treat!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 teaspoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (16 oz) package of finely shredded  mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (24 oz) jar of prepared marinara sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees lightly oil 9x13 baking dish</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shells in water
            stirring occasionally until tender, about 10-12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a heavy skillet. Cook and crumble sausage until it has lost its pink color and begins to brown. Remove from heat; drain off grease. Stir 1/2 of the shredded cheese and Italian seasoning into browned sausage.</li>
        <li>Spoon sausage mixture into pasta shells (1 to 2 tablespoons per shell). Arrange stuffed shells in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Pour marinara sauce evenly over the shells. Top with remaining shredded cheese. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove foil; bake until browned, 5 to 10 more minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of Italian seasoning, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
